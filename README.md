# rcurto_investments

This repository contains the Google Apps Script project files and supporting data.

The Apps Script now computes trade profit/loss values in code rather than relying on formulas in the sheet.

## Running Tests

A small Jest-based test suite validates analytics helper calculations.

Install dependencies (once):

```bash
npm install
```

Execute the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
